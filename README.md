# â›… Weather Data Analysis

This project provides an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of weather conditions using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. It helps understand patterns, anomalies, and relationships between weather variables such as temperature, visibility, wind speed, and weather conditions.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

The notebook answers various questions using a weather dataset, including:

- How many times was weather exactly clear?
- What is the mean visibility?
- When was the highest wind speed recorded?
- What weather conditions occur most frequently?
- What is the relationship between different weather features?

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset includes fields such as:

- `Date/Time`
- `Temp (C)`
- `Visibility (km)`
- `Wind Speed (km/h)`
- `Weather Condition`

Make sure the dataset file (CSV format) is placed in the notebook directory or properly loaded.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nyametay/weather-data-analysis.git
cd weather-data-analysis
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook "Weather Notebook.ipynb"
```

### ðŸ“Š Features
- Cleaning and preprocessing weather data

- Grouping and filtering with pandas

- Descriptive statistics and condition-based filtering

- Visual analysis with bar plots and line plots

- Querying specific weather conditions and comparing variables

### ðŸ“ˆ Example Analyses
- Frequency of specific weather types

- Times when visibility was exactly 40 km

- Conditions when mean wind speed was above a threshold

- Relationships between weather conditions and temperature
